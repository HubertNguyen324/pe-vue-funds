# User Inputs

We will continue to learn about the reactivity system in this lesson. You'll learn how to handle user inputs with the `v-model` directive. `v-model` gives super powers to text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, selects, and more!

<div class="vue-interactive-solution" data-solution-id="list" data-vue-app-script="list.js">
    <h3>A Simple Item List</h3>
    <div class="solution-container" id="vue-app-list"></div>
</div>
